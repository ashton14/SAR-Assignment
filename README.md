***My Submission***
Agent: Health Assessor Agent

Skills: Medical expertise, drug knowledge, health status prediction

Roles:
1. Assess likely health status of missing person
2. Determine necessary medications
3. Determine urgency of necessary treatment
4. Assess mobility of missing person
5. Extract medical conditions from medical history

### Insights
The Health Assessor Agent demonstrates strong health/medical assessment capabilities with accurate and informative responses, effective handling of missing inputs, correct prioritization of urgency, logical responses for unknowns, and efficient code. However, improvements are needed in reducing excessive verbosity in mobility assessments, adding missing dependencies to requirements, clarifying testing instructions in the README, and enhancing input documentation in functions

### Modifications
- Added more detailed documentation to explain the input and output of each function with an example use case.
- Added a function to extract allergies from a medical history form
- Modified the prompts being sent to Google Gemeni API for a more concise return value.
- Added a necessary package to requirements.txt
- Added instructions for API key in README

# Search and Rescue (SAR) Agent Framework - CSC 581

## Introduction

This framework is for CSC 581 students to develop intelligent agents supporting the AI4S&R project. Students can create specialized agents for various SAR roles such as those listed in this spreadsheet:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QZK5HAdDC-_XNui6S0JZTbJH5_PbYJTp8_gyhXmz8Ek/edit?usp=sharing
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11rBV9CbKNeQbWbaks8TF6GO7WcSUDS_-hAoH75UEkgQ/edit?usp=sharing

Each student or team will choose a specific role within the SAR ecosystem and implement an agent that provides decision support and automation for that role.

## How to Submit
Please submit a link to your clone of the repository to Canvas. 

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pyenv (recommended for Python version management)
- pip (for dependency management)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sar-project
```

2. Set up Python environment:
```bash
# Using pyenv (recommended)
pyenv install 3.9.6  # or your preferred version
pyenv local 3.9.6

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

4. Configure environment variables:

#### Google Gemini:
- Obtain required API keys:
  1. ``` pip install google-generativeai ```
  2. ``` import google.generativeai as genai ```
  3. Google Gemini API Key: Obtain at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
  4. Add GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your_api_key" to .env file

Make sure to keep your `.env` file private and never commit it to version control.

5. Make sure to update requirements.txt when adding dependencies


## FAQ

### Assignment Questions

**Q: How do I choose a role for my agent?**

**A:** Review the list of SAR roles above and consider which aspects interest you most. Your agent should provide clear value to SAR operations through automation, decision support, or information processing.

**Q: What capabilities should my agent have?**

**A:** Your agent should handle tasks relevant to its role such as: data processing, decision making, communication with other agents, and providing actionable information to human operators.

**Q: Can I add new dependencies?**

**A:** Yes, you can add new Python packages to requirements.txt as needed for your implementation.


### Technical Questions

**Q: Why am I getting API key errors?**

**A:** Ensure you've properly set up your .env file and obtained valid API keys from the services listed above.

**Q: How do I test my agent?**

**A:** Use the provided test framework in the tests/ directory. Write tests that verify your agent's core functionality.

**Q: Can I use external libraries for my agent?**

**A:** Yes, you can use external libraries as long as they are compatible.
